This is my personal portfolio website, which I built as part of my internship at Codsoft. It showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in web development. The website is designed to be simple yet elegant, focusing on clear navigation and a responsive layout.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the website.
CSS3: For the styling and layout.
